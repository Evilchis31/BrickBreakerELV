# BrickBreakerELV

What was originally planned for your final project?

My original plan for my final project was to create a sports data application where you can look up the stats for any sport for any players or any teams, but I realized it was too much so then I wanted to change it to not make it hard on myself and go with something more simple.



What was delivered in your Final Project?

What was delivered in my final project was I wanted a create a game that was simple and fun to play. I ended up creating my game called BrickBreakerELV. It is a game where you have to keep bouncing the ball with your paddle to get as many points as possible by breaking the blocks until they are all gone within the time limit.



What would be the next feature(s) you would add if you had more time?

A feature I would like to add if I had more time was add more levels to make the gameplay interesting and change the difficulty so it is not the same thing over and over again. I would also like to add different designs to my game to make it stand out like adding special effects and stuff like that.
